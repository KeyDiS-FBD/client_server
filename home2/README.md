Asynchronous - non-blocking
Several clients are connecting to the server (number of clients - server parameter via command line argument 1-5)
We print everything that customers send to the screen by 1 byte (letters) in the format:
client: letter

## Example:

client 1 send message: "hello"
client 2 send message: "hi"
client 1 send message: "yes"

server - first send first printed:
1: h
1: e
1: l
1: l
1: o
2: h
